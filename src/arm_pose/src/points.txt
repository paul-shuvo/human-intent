so as the depth data was extremely noisy, and wasn't adding anything to the project,
 I decided to remove that part from the paper for the time being. 

Without reliable depth information, there is not a lot to add to the paper,
because the work kind of was mostly depending on that information.

I think later, I would need to calibrate the camera to at least try and see if I can get 
more reliable depth information.

So, i've only used the rgb image to estimate pointing gesture and pointing direction and 
pointed objects under some minimal assumption. And as I've told you before, I've used 
the verbal commands to extract certain information, to kind of facillaitate
formulation of a structured language for robots.



So I think with what I have I can write a paper of length around 8 pages ieee double
column format.

I will finish the paper by this weekend and share it with you.

I just want to get done with this paper with whatever I have and later on
can fix and add things on top of it.
